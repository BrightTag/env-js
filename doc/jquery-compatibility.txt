== Testing Methodology ==
1) Either grab Thatcher's branch for the given date, or make sure your branch 
   is up to date with all his patches for that date.  (github.com/thatcher/env-js)

2) Run ./bin/test-jquery.sh $VERSION for each version: 1.3.2, 1.3.1, and 1.2.6.

3) Record the number of tests passed/failed/errors reported via the command line.

4) If running a given version of jQuery for the first time, then:
   a) cd ./test/vendor/jQuery/$VERSION/test
   b) open index.html in Firefox
   c) let the tests run to completion
   d) note the total number of tests at the bottom of the page
   e) subtract the number of tests passed & failed from this total
   f) the result is the number of tests that were not ran because
      of exceptions halting the execution of a test file

5) Note the date and your email here.
