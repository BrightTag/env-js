Building:
* run "ant concat"
* Creates a platform-agnostic "dist/env.js" file and a Rhino-specific "dist/env.rhino.js" file.

Installing:
* Include the proper env.js file for your platform.
    load('env.rhino.js'); //if in a Rhino script
* Set the window location to an HTML file you want env.js to model:
    window.location = "some/file.html";
* (See the test/test.js file for a more elaborate setup.)

Testing:
* run "make rhino-test"
